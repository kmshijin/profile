                <h2> Sr. Lab Instructor</h2>
                <p> Christ College of Engineering (CCE), established in 2015, is affiliated to APJ Abdul Kalam Technological
                    University, Thiruvananthapuram; and is recognized by AICTE, New Delhi. This college was found at a time
                    when starting a new engineering college was not considered as a sensible proposition. In its short span
                    of existence, exceeding all expectations and proving all critics wrong, Christ College of Engineering
                    has managed to create ripples on the academic front in the university, so much so that today the college
                    is being recognized as one of the best self-financing engineering colleges in Kerala.
                    Staff and students are at the center of this success story. No stone is being left unturned in ensuring
                    that along with academics, the students get the right amount of exposure required for tomorrowâ€™s
                    successful global citizen, through the various initiatives held at this campus. With the kind of
                    transformative learning model in place here, the college is well on its way to making a positive impact
                    on our society and nation at large.</p>
